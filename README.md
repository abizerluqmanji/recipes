# Recipes

Webpage for easy to make recipes

## Adding Recipes

- Add a new recipe as a Markdown file under the `recipes/` directory. Use the `format.md` template as a guide.
- Update `recipes/index.yml` to include the new file (add an object with `file` and `title`).

## TODO

Add annoyingly long AI-generated stories for each recipe
