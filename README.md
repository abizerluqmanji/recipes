# Recipes

Webpage for easy to make recipes

## Publishing and usage

- Add a new recipe as a Markdown file under the `recipes/` directory. Each file must include three sections with headings exactly named `Description`, `Ingredients`, and `Directions`.
- Update `recipes/index.json` to include the new file (add an object with `file` and optional `title`).

## TODO

Add annoyingly long AI-generated stories for each recipe
